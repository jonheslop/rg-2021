                I am a Senior UX Designer with 10 years of experience in the
                industry, working in both startups and large corporations.
                Exploring problems and putting the user at the centre of my work
                is something I am deeply passionate about. I thrive on finding
                solutions that are both creative and impactful, something I will
                continue to strive for in all areas of my work. In our ever
                increasing digital lives, I am excited to make a difference to
                peopleâ€™s experiences within a cross functional and collaborative
                team.
